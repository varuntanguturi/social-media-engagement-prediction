# Social Media Engagement Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting social media engagement rates using regression techniques. It's designed as a beginner-friendly data science project that covers the entire machine learning workflow from data generation to model evaluation. The project uses synthetic social media data to predict engagement rates based on various post and account features.

## Features and Capabilities
- Synthetic data generation with realistic social media engagement features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Implementation of multiple regression models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Step-by-step Jupyter notebook tutorial

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy - Numerical computing
- scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- Matplotlib - Data visualization
- Seaborn - Enhanced data visualization
- Jupyter - Interactive notebook environment

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-engagement-prediction.git
   cd social-media-engagement-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

## Usage Instructions
### Generating Data
To generate synthetic social media data:
```
python main.py --generate-data --samples 1000 --output data/social_media_data.csv
```

### Data Exploration
To run exploratory data analysis:
```
python main.py --explore-data --input data/social_media_data.csv
```

### Training Models
To train regression models:
```
python main.py --train-models --input data/social_media_data.csv
```

### Evaluating Models
To evaluate model performance:
```
python main.py --evaluate-models
```

### Running the Complete Pipeline
To run the entire workflow from data generation to evaluation:
```
python main.py --run-all
```

### Interactive Tutorial
To explore the project interactively:
```
jupyter notebook notebooks/social_media_engagement_analysis.ipynb
```

## Data Description
The synthetic social media engagement data includes the following features:
- `post_length`: Number of characters in the post
- `images_count`: Number of images included in the post
- `hashtags_count`: Number of hashtags used
- `post_time`: Time of day when the post was published
- `followers_count`: Number of followers the account has
- `engagement_rate`: Target variable - percentage of followers who engaged with the post

The engagement rate is calculated based on a formula that considers all features with some randomness to simulate real-world data patterns.
